# Bitcoin Sentiment Tracker Demo

This demo combines a simple **Python back‑end** and a **React front‑end** to
present a daily sentiment score for Bitcoin.  The goal is to display a
numeric score on a 1–10 scale together with a short summary of recent
news, all generated by Google’s Gemini model.

The repository is organised into two subfolders:

| Folder   | Purpose                                                |
|---------:|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `backend/` | Contains a Flask app (`app.py`) and its dependencies.  It fetches recent Bitcoin news, prompts the Gemini model for a daily analysis, extracts an overall sentiment label and maps it to a 1–10 score. |
| `frontend/` | Contains a Vite/React application that calls the back‑end API, displays the sentiment score and summary, and lists information sources. |

## Running the Back‑end

To start the Python server:

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set your Gemini API key in the environment (replace `your_api_key` with your real key):

   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```

3. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

The server will listen on `http://localhost:5000` and expose an endpoint
at `/api/sentiment` that returns a JSON object with the fields `score`,
`sentimentText` and `sources`.

## Running the Front‑end

To start the React app:

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install Node dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. Launch the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Vite will start a server on `http://localhost:3000`.  Thanks to the
proxy configuration in `vite.config.ts`, calls to `/api/sentiment` from
the front‑end will be forwarded to the Flask back‑end running on port
5000.  Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` and click
**“Get Today's Sentiment”** to fetch and display the latest Bitcoin
sentiment.

## Customisation

- **Feeds:** The list of RSS feeds queried by the back‑end is defined in
  `backend/app.py` (`rss_feeds`).  You can add or remove feed URLs to
  capture different news sources.
- **Prompt:** The prompt passed to the Gemini model lives in
  `backend/app.py` as well.  Adjust the wording or sections to tailor
  the output.
- **Scoring:** The back‑end extracts a single word (e.g., *Bullish* or
  *Bearish*) from the model’s `### Overall Sentiment` section and maps
  it to a number between 1 (bearish) and 10 (bullish).  The mapping is
  defined in the `map_sentiment_to_score` function.
- **Front‑end styles:** The front‑end uses Tailwind CSS via a CDN and a
  few custom rules in `frontend/index.css`.  You can extend or replace
  these styles to match your desired look.

This project is intended as a minimal starting point.  To build a more
robust sentiment tracker, consider integrating the full scoring and
clustering pipeline from your earlier `sentiment.py` script and
creating charts or historical views on the front‑end.
